# South Park: The Breast Cancer Show Ever (Season 12 Episode 9), OR What's Inexplicably Beautiful About the Attachment to the Self

I think Wendy has like maybe 6 or 7 episodes where she's the protagonist. But every time they make it a Wendy episode, you know it's going to be one that sticks with you. This one sneaks up on you like that.
